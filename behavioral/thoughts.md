I took a step backwards to go forwards
Going from NASA and really owning a project, doing well in it, then asking for more at a a startup, I exposed myself to my weaknesses.
I was weak technically, I couldn't meet deadlines on time, I didn't understand have a command of frontend fundamentals.
I had a belief that if I were to continue on my path - I wouldn't have been ready.
I took a step backwards in a career-sense
It was a deliberate conscious process, it was part of a bigger picture and bigger plan - I had a belief in myself that I could teach myself the fundamentals
I thought in 5 years, what I would look like, and taking this step I thought this could position me for a good job if I were successful.

Everything I had done had been tested
