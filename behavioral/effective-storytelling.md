### Pitfalls

Pitfalls with Behavior Answers (what impacts the scoring and what are examples of mistakes)

- You underestimate the time to properly communicate your answers
  - PRACTICE AND ROLEPLAY - LOTS
- People are great theorizing - but do not answer hypothetically. “Whenever I have a disagreement I do this this and this“ -> This will disqualify you.
  - Go with real experiences, “I remember a situation where I had a disagreement with my team, I did my best to listen etc. usually I have an approach for xyz“
  - In a 5 hours interview, it is inevitable that you’ll go general…
- Do not get lost in the details
  - be straightforward and be business like
  - only explain the relevant detail
  - especially if HR has no technical acumen

### Preparation

- Prepare two stories for each of the leadership principles
- SDE (these are the core competencies, start here)
  - customer obsession
  - ownership
  - dive deep
  - think big
- Focus on your strengths

## Bad Answers during a Behavioral Interview

Bad Answers during an Amazon Interview

- Question: are you easy to get along with?
  - could you think of a time that you exhibited interpersonal skills?
- Question: Why Amazon?
  - Bad: generic answers
  - Good: I want to work at Amazon for three reasons.
    - why/how can you make a difference
    - what differentiates yourself from other applicants
    - what’s in it for you, what do you win from this, where do you see yourself in 5 years
      - projects can only go so far with other businesses - scale
      - etc.
- Question: What’s your weakness?
  - Bad: Turning a positive into a negative
  - What are you liable for?
- Question: Time when you had a conflict on a team?
  - do not put blame on someone else - no he said, she said situation
  - not your job to talk about someone else, you’re supposed to talk about yourself
  - there is no chance on getting to Amazon if you put the blame on your team
    - TAKE OWNERSHIP of the conflict
    - Discuss the positives that come from the conflict
    - be careful not to put the blame on anyone (limit your time of taking about what they did this)
    - Talk about “I did this“ generally speaking

## Tough Questions and Tips How to Answer

Question: Tell Me about a time you apologized to someone

- see interpersonal skills
- if you’re someone who is able to listen to other parties or rather reactive than proactive
- example should be genuine and recent - say in 1.5 minutes
  Question: What’s your weakness
- I lack the ability to project manage.
- Perhaps introverted?
  Question: A time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem
- should have used a react rather than vanilla
- I was wrong because I didn’t understand the space of Javascript and the ecosystem well enough
- Ability to analyze a particular situation and perhaps ask for help
- This is behavioral question - use STAR
  Question: A time where you were 75% through a project and had to pivot strategy
- success story - not asking for failure. Struggled to deliver something because something outside of your power changed - this triggered your problem-solving skills
- Zoom into a situation for changing scope
- Think about a project hat had some challenges and had to change scope
  Question: tell me about a time that you failed
- quantify something that had an impact and you grew from it
- must be a genuine one
- you can read genuine ones out within the first few seconds
- are you the type to learn and grow from your failures?
- 1-2 sentences for situation, 2-3 for action, and 3 or more sentences for the learnings - how you grew from that specific failure. Talk about the learnings in a positive context - sell positivity

## Failure Stories

Tell me about a time you failed

Amazon EMBRACES failure!! TAKES RISKS AND EMBRACES IT! The biggest worry is if you have not embraced your failures yet

### Finding a failure story

Finding a failure story - it is failed expectations with a consequence
Six areas

1. tell me about a time that you failed to deliver something significant on time
   1. example that makes sense and had consequences
   2. if internal deadline, and deadline was set by you and had no consequence if you missed it, then that’s not a good enough for example
2. tell me about a time that you failed to meet your clients’ expectations
   1. customer obsession context if prepping for Amazon interview
   2. more significant the failure, the better the opportunity to convince them that you are a person who can learn and grow from these failures
3. tell me about a significant mistake you made
   1. thought process, ability to take a decisions and analyze the situation
   2. find a significant enough mistake that makes sense in a failure context
4. goal that you failed you achieved
   1. doesn’t have to be in a time context
   2. you set a goal and failed to achieve that goal - maybe you tried repeated times and just failed - the story is in context of delivering results
5. tell me about a decision that your regret
   1. find a decision that would qualify as failure in a professional context, decision-making is important for job employers to look at
6. Tell me about a time that you took a risk unsuccessfully 1. fast-paced project and failed eventually 2. see if you can frame it properly within a failure context 3. more recent the better it is
   Interviewers are looking for two main things

- quality of failure: a proper failure
- what you learned from it:
  - spend 50% of the time answering doing what you learned - STAR format
  - results = learnings
  - this is how you structure your failure
  - To determine if it’s a good failure story to communicate, test if it’s quantifiable. What would have happened if nothing happened or you succeeded - is this a proper failure?
    - what was this consequence?
    - If you have challenges quantifying for failures - that would leave a question mark

It all ties into the concept of one-way doors and two-way door decisions, I think they're looking for two way door failures and recovery moreso than you running your position into the ground and leaving a company.

Question: Tell me about a time that you took a risk unsuccessfully

- fast-paced project and failed eventually
  - expectation: deliver the calendar feature w/in a timeframe
  - business-context: losing users, short runway (1 year)
  - mindset: implemented emails and messaging feature, calendar would be a challenge but do-able
  - outcome: failed to deliver on-time
  - results: what did I learn? Not hard and fast rules, but in many cases, it makes sense to evaluate the scope of a feature/project from an under-promise and over-deliver mindset - worst case scenario what’s the longest this will take me? what are the things that are the biggest blocks to my outcome and how can I remove those things?

Because you will be overqualified, technically
And there will be a number of talented candidates technical-wise, the company will screen you for culture fit
They will see you will see what toxic or behavioral flaws you have - that is much harder to change in their eyes

Therefore, you will need to put on a good show. You will need to have a strong case as to why you want to work for the company and how you can make a difference there. Prepare convincing answers, why do you want to switch roles
