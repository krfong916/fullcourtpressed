# Question: Tell Me About Yourself

## Tips

It’s about behavior and attitude towards the question:

- Tell me about yourself - make it a compelling or emotional answer
  - Boring: "I am a software engineer so I… list your experiences, highlights, and achievements"
- Want to know about your strengths when applying for this role
- Want to see how well you can efficiently communicate
- Avoid long answers - Almost every time long answers can be shorter
  - Not often a topic is worth explaining for 4-5 minutes to talk about
- Problematic approach: starting with a general statement
  - The idea is to get specific right off the bat - get to the bread and butter
- Try less to impress and spend the initial time with the best possible story
- If you can, add some levity and fun!

### Pitfalls

- Don’t make "Tell me about yourself" sound like an enumeration (how you’d present your CV) because it’s boring.
  give them the main highlights and what they want to hear from you
  - Enumerating makes it hard for HR to choose a strength of yours
  - Many people use this as a conversation as a starting point for a conversation.

### Guidelines

- Use critical thinking if you think it’s a good answer.
- Keep it around 1-1.5 minutes
- What sounds competent and genuine to you will sound great to them
- help the audience understand why they would hire me
- don’t be afraid of showcasing what you’re good at and where you come from
- touch on the interesting points when it comes to talking about yourself while considering applying for a role

## Notes For FE, Amazon roles

I am driven to deliver products that get it right for the user. I worked on a team at NASA and we designed an architected an enterprise application. I lead the creation of a design research group and built the application's user interface and frontend (must tailor this so it is true - David made the contacts, I did the study). As a result of my contributions, I am directly responsible for the acceptance of the project during two key phases in its lifecycle and most importantly, its increase in runway and budget.

- SRR system requirements review
- Secondly, I presented my contributions and future plans to senior leadership. This resulted in our project passing - PDR preliminary design review. Passing PDR means approval for implementation. To put this achievement in perspective, we were the second project ever at the Armstrong center to recieve zero pushback from leadership.
- I contribute our project's success directly
  to listening to the needs of our users and taking seriously the recommendations of our participants of our design research group.
- This experience was important to me because I learned software must be created user-centered.

Secondly, my most recent project I built a web application from scratch and launched it. This project is a
